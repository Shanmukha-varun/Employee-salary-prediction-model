üí∞ Employee Income Classifier
This project develops and deploys a machine learning model to predict whether an individual's annual income is greater than $50,000 or less than/equal to $50,000, based on various demographic and employment attributes. The goal is to provide an accurate, data-driven tool for income bracket classification, reducing human bias and improving efficiency.

‚ú® Features
Income Prediction: Predicts if an individual's income is >50K or <=50K.

Interactive Web App: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit for real-time predictions.

Robust Preprocessing: Handles missing values, performs feature engineering, outlier capping, and categorical encoding.

Model Comparison: Evaluates multiple classification algorithms to identify the best performer.

üöÄ Technologies Used
Python: Programming language.

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: For numerical operations.

scikit-learn: Machine learning library for preprocessing (StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, ColumnTransformer), model training (GradientBoostingClassifier), and evaluation (accuracy_score, classification_report).

joblib: For saving and loading the trained machine learning model.

streamlit: For building the interactive web application.

Git & GitHub: For version control and deployment.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally:

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY

(Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPOSITORY with your actual GitHub details)

Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure Model File is Present:
Make sure best_model_pipeline_GradientBoosting.joblib is in the same directory as app.py. This file should have been pushed from your Colab environment.

üèÉ How to Run the Streamlit App
Once the setup is complete, you can run the Streamlit application:

streamlit run app.py

This command will open the Streamlit app in your web browser, usually at http://localhost:8501. If running in a cloud environment like Google Colab, look for the "External URL" provided in the terminal output.

üìä Model Details
Problem Type: Binary Classification

Target Variable: income_>50K (True/False)

Chosen Model: Gradient Boosting Classifier

Key Preprocessing:

Handling missing values (? replaced with NaN, then dropped).

Outlier capping (IQR method).

One-Hot Encoding for categorical features (workclass, marital-status, etc.).

Standard Scaling for numerical features.
